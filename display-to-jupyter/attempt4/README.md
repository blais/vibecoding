I'd like to build a program that can

a. open a connection to a running Jupyter kernel
b. send a snippet (a cell) of Python code to be executed on the kernel
c. obtains a stream of the result's elements
d. display each of the elements to a NiceGUI

NiceGUI can be found at https://nicegui.io/

Write me a Python library and example program that can do that. In doing so, you
have to use only Python code but you may use any of the Jupyter or other Python
libraries to do so.
