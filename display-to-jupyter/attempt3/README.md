Gemini:

Can you write an alternative web client interface to a Jupyter notebook, one
that (a) does not support editing cells, (b) renders the cells in the same
way as the regular Jupyter web client, but (c) also automatically refreshes when
a notebook is modified.

Reuse as much of the existing open source libraries for Jupyter.
